# Code Challenge: High-Order Array Methods

## Instructions

1. Clone down this assignment to AWS Cloud9. 
2. Code your solution using JavaScript in `index.js`. 
3. **Be sure to run and test your code throughly!**
4. By the end of Code Challenge, **commit and push your changes up to Github**.
5. Using the browser, verify that your solution is in your remote repo on Github.

## Problems 

1. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array containing only the even numbers in the original array.
```js
onlyEven([3, 15, 2, 18, 21, 26]); //returns [2, 18, 26]
```

2. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array with the original array elements doubled.
```js
doubled([2, 40, 14, 3, 25]); //returns [4, 80, 28, 6, 50]
```

3. Write a function that takes a string argument and returns a new string with vowels deleted.
```js
removeVowelsString("code challenge"); //returns "cd chllng"
```

4. Write a function that takes a string and returns that string in snake case (all lowercase characteres with underscores between words):
```js
snakeCase("This is a Sentence"); // returns "this_is_a_sentence"
